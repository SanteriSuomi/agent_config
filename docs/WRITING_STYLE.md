# Writing Style (Anti-Slop)

Remove AI-generated writing patterns. Good humanized writing has genuine voice, varied rhythm, specific details, and acknowledges complexity.

## Content Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Inflated significance | "groundbreaking", "transformative", "pioneering" | State facts without superlatives |
| Overclaiming | "widely acclaimed", "universally recognized" | Remove or cite source |
| Superficial -ing analysis | "showcasing", "highlighting", "demonstrating" | Use concrete verbs |
| Promotional tone | "exceptional", "unparalleled", "state-of-the-art" | Describe, don't advertise |
| Vague attribution | "experts say", "studies show" | Cite specific sources or remove |
| Formulaic challenges | "Despite challenges..." as filler | Only if genuinely relevant |

## Language Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Bad | Good |
|---------|-----|------|
| Copula avoidance | "serves as", "functions as" | "is" |
| Negative parallelism | "not just X, but Y" | "X and Y" or just state directly |
| Rule of three | Always listing 3 things | Vary: 1, 2, 4, 5 items |
| Synonym cycling | "happy, joyful, elated" in same paragraph | Pick one word |
| False ranges | "from X to Y" when unnecessary | Be specific or drop |

## Overused AI Words

**Avoid:** delve, crucial, vital, essential, significant, notably, moreover, furthermore, comprehensive, robust, seamless, cutting-edge, innovative, leverage, utilize, facilitate, streamline, harness, foster, enhance, bolster, underscore, multifaceted, intricate, nuanced, paradigm, synergy, holistic

**Use instead:** Direct, simple words. "Important" not "crucial". "Use" not "utilize".

## Style Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Issue |
|---------|-------|
| Em dash overuse | One per paragraph max |
| Excessive bold | For emphasis, not decoration |
| Formatted lists with colons | "**Item:** description" - often unnecessary |
| Title Case in Headings | Use sentence case |
| Decorative emojis | Only if explicitly requested |
| Curly quotes | Use straight quotes in code/docs |

## Filler to Remove

- "In order to" → "To"
- "It's important to note that" → (delete, just state it)
- "As you can see" → (delete)
- "Let me explain" → (delete, just explain)
- "I'll now show you" → (delete, just show)
- "Basically" → (delete)
- "Actually" → (delete)
- "Obviously" → (delete, if obvious don't say it)
- "Simply" → (delete)
- "Just" → (delete unless comparing)

## AI Artifacts to Remove

- "As of my knowledge cutoff..."
- "I don't have access to real-time..."
- "Based on the information provided..."
- Sycophantic openers: "Great question!", "Excellent point!"
- Hedging: "It might be", "could potentially", "may possibly"
- Meta-commentary: "I think", "In my opinion" (unless specifically asked)

## What Good Writing Looks Like

- **Specific** - Concrete details, not vague generalizations
- **Direct** - Start with the point, not wind-up
- **Varied** - Different sentence lengths and structures
- **Active** - "The function returns X" not "X is returned by the function"
- **Honest** - Acknowledge limitations, don't oversell
- **Opinionated** - Take a stance when appropriate

## Application

Use when writing:
- Documentation
- Comments
- Commit messages
- UI copy
- Error messages
- README files
- Any user-facing text
