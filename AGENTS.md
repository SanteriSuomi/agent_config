## Just-In-Time Reference

**You MUST load relevant docs before starting work:**

| Task | Load |
|------|------|
| Writing code | `~/.agents/docs/CODE_STYLE.md` |
| Adding comments | `~/.agents/docs/COMMENTS.md` |
| Running tests | `~/.agents/docs/TESTING.md` |
| Making commits | `~/.agents/docs/COMMIT_STYLE.md` |
| Building UI | `~/.agents/docs/DESIGN_STYLE.md` |

## Critical Rules

1. **Be concise** — minimal code, minimal prose, minimal steps. Say it once, say it right.
2. **Use current year** — in all web searches, research, and documentation lookups

## Project Discovery

Check project's dependency manifest for tech stack and framework. Look for config files in project root (tsconfig, eslint, cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.).
